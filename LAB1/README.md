Question:

Write a Java Program that will collect an employee's basic details that fall into different data types and displays them.
After the details have been displayed, with the help of conditional statements, check if the gender of the employee is 'm' or 'f'. It should print "MALE" for 'm' and "FEMALE" for 'f'.
Assume that you can divide the states among India into different regions (North, South, Central, East, and West). If the employee is from the southern part of India, with the help of a switch statement, it should display "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in <state>", along with the basic details.
Identify if the employee belongs to the top MNC Companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, Apple); if so, print a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".

Description about the Program :

The above Java program collects the basic details of an employee and displays them on the console. The employee details include name, age, gender, state, and company. The program uses the Scanner class to input the details from the user.
After the details have been displayed, a conditional statement checks the gender of the employee. If the gender is 'm', it prints "MALE", and if it is 'f', it prints "FEMALE".
Next, the program checks if the employee belongs to one of the southern states of India (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, or Karnataka) using another conditional statement. If the employee belongs to one of these states, it prints a message "The Employee is from the southern states of India; Preferable work location is in [state name]".
Finally, the program uses a switch statement to check if the company of the employee is one of the top MNC companies (Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, IBM, or Apple). If the employee works in one of these companies, it prints a message "The employee is working in Top MNC Companies".
